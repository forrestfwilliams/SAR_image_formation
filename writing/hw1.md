## 1
The recieved waveform will have a "half baguette" shape that gets thinner and thinner (e.g., increasing frequency) as the boat gets closer to the transmitter.

## 2
###### a
4.35 dB
###### b
22.41 dB
The SNR is much higher in this case because decreasing the wavelength increase the gain exponentially

## 3
All designs with use an antenna efficiency of 50% and a noise temperature of 900K.
###### a
For L-band, using a peak transmit power of 350 Watts, we can achieve an SNR of 10.35 dB.
###### b
For C-band, using a peak transmit power of 90 Watts, we can achieve an SNR of 10.48 dB.
For K-band, using a peak transmit power of 30 Watts, we can achieve an SNR of 10.48 dB.
###### c
In this case, SNR still increases with frequency, but it does so linearly instead of exponentially.
